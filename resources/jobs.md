### Batch jobs
Use cmd-t to show the Transfers window and select the Batch Jobs tab. This panel keeps track of any jobs that are submitted during the current session. As jobs finish the information shown here will be updated.  
![Jobs](jobs1.png?raw=true "jobs")  
Completed jobs can have their output copied from the JES queue to your own dataset using the Execute button (this also deletes it from JES). After the output has been copied, it can be downloaded using the same mechanism.  
![Jobs](jobs2.png?raw=true "jobs")  
The output is available from the Files tab. From there you can print reports to your own printer, and also save a local copy on your PC.
